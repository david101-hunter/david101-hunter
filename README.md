## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is Máº¡nh, but it's too hard for some foreign people to pronounce, so you can call me David.

I spent my childhood growing up in Hung Ha district, Thai Binh province, but I've been living in Hanoi sence 2015.

There are four people in my family, I live with my brother in Hanoi and my parents live in Thai Binh. I'm sill single and I have no plans to get marriaged.

I love listening to music and reading book in my free time, because I don't have much time and it makes me feel relaxed. Furthermore I like getting out of city on the weekend to explore the surrounding areas.

Luckily, I'm a computer science graduate with a very good degree. I have three years of experience in Java Development, special with Spring Boot framework.

Currently, I work as a AI Enginneer in Viettel Digital from 2023. We focus on developing AI use cases, especially implementing LLMs in daily work to optimize resources and work efficiency. 

That's all, thank for taking the time to reading about me. I look forward to receiving your help in my repositories by performing pull requests to all my projects.

Have a good day, good time!

David.
